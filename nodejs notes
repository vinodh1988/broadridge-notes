JS that runs in browser will not essentially  run in nodejs
  becuase browser libraries are not supported in nodejs
  
  
  Common library functions and objects supported both in nodejs and browser
  
      console
	  setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate
	  Some objects like Math, Date, Regex...
	  
Limitations of running js in browser

   We cannot access filesystem(read and write files in os)
   we cannot access db servers (rbdms or no sql)
   we cannot handle http request and provide responses( Http cannot be handled)
   We cannot access os functionalities
   We cannot access a mail server 
   We cannot access network services and connect with them
   
   (all these are usally handled by a server side technology)
   
  But all the above things can be done using javascript in node js and
  node js has inbuilt/ third party libraries to do this.
